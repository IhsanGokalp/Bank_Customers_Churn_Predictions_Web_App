  Here are summary statistics for non-churned customers:

  - If the customer has over 40% of churning, generate a 3 sentence explanation of why they are churning.
  - If the customer has less than 40% of churning, generate a 3 sentence explanation of why they might not be at risk of churning.
  - Your explanation should be based on the customer's information, the summary statistics of churned and non-churned customers, and the feature importances provided.

  Don't mention the probability of churning, or the machiene learning model or say anything like "Based on the machiene learing model's prediction and top 10 most important features", just explain the prediction.
